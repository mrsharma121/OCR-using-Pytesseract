# OCR-using-Pytesseract
## This is my first Time working on Computer Vision and before working on this project the only Tesseract i knew was the one which loki took away from his father(Talking about a Marvel movie).
### Please look into the file everything is there and i tried my best so that any person who just started working on openCV can understand the code with little to no knowledge.
Also i Would like to thank Piyush Gandhi (CTO and co-founder of Qubitrics) for this amazing Opportunity.
